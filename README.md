This ReadMe is for notes on what I have learned about Kubernetes, they are not structured in any form or way just for my own refernce.

## A simple K8s Overview.
Kubernetes (K8s) is a software system for running multiple containers in set of multiple machines.

## Components That help work with k8s
- `minikube` for managing containers in the virtual machines.
- `kubectl` for managing the virtual machines within the cluster.

### Commands
`minikube start` starts a virtual machine that will be our K8s cluster?
`minikube status` checks if there's any cluster started?
